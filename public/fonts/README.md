# Local Fonts

The actual font files are not committed to this repository.

Download the following `.woff2` fonts and place them in this directory so they match the filenames referenced in `fonts.css`:

- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
- [Hind Siliguri](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind+Siliguri)
- [Noto Sans Bengali](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+Bengali)
- [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono)
- [VT323](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323)

You can download the fonts directly from Google Fonts or another trusted source. After downloading, ensure each `.woff2` file is saved with the same filename that `fonts.css` expects.
