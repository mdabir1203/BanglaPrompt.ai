## Supabase & Email Setup

A Supabase project is required for storing newsletter signups, analytics and contact messages. An edge function (`send-contact-email`) uses [Resend](https://resend.com/) to send confirmation emails. Set the following environment variables when deploying the function:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
