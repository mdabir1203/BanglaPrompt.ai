🧠 How Prompt Bangla Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Prompt Bangla is a Bengali-first AI assistant designed to answer user queries by intelligently combining document retrieval with natural language generation. This is made possible by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, which enhances the quality, factual accuracy, and relevance of the AI's responses.

📌 What is RAG?
RAG is a two-stage pipeline that:

Retrieves relevant content from a large knowledge base (e.g., uploaded Bengali documents, cultural datasets, or public resources).

Augments the input to a generative model (like GPT) with that retrieved context, allowing the model to generate more grounded, accurate, and helpful responses.

🔍 RAG Workflow in Prompt Bangla
Step	Component	Description
1️⃣	Document Upload	Users upload Bengali PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files through a web/mobile interface.
2️⃣	Text Chunking	Documents are split into manageable, semantically meaningful text chunks using LangChain's splitters.
3️⃣	Vector Embedding	Each chunk is transformed into a vector using OpenAI/Bengali-compatible embeddings.
4️⃣	Vector Storage	Embeddings are stored in a vector database like FAISS or ChromaDB for fast similarity search.
5️⃣	Query Handling	When a user asks a question, Prompt Bangla retrieves the most relevant chunks via semantic search.
6️⃣	Response Generation	The retrieved chunks are passed as context to a language model (via LangChain's retrieval chain) to generate a well-informed Bengali answer.

🚀 Why RAG is Essential for Prompt Bangla
✅ Domain-Aware: It answers questions based on specific uploaded or community-shared documents.

✅ Language-First: Retrieval enables the generation of context-rich Bengali responses even when the base model isn't natively fluent in cultural or historical nuances.

✅ Low Hallucination: By grounding responses in real documents, RAG dramatically reduces the chance of AI making things up.

✅ Scalable & Localized: New documents and dialects can be added seamlessly to expand its knowledge.

🔧 Technologies Used
LangChain: For creating custom RAG chains.

FAISS / Chroma: For vector-based semantic retrieval.

OpenAI + HuggingFace: For embeddings and generation.

FastAPI / Django: For backend API to serve RAG queries.

S3 + AWS EC2/ECS: For document storage and cloud deployment.
